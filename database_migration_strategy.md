# Fido Multi-Agent AI Database Schema - Migration Strategy

## Current State Analysis
- **Existing Tables**: users (varchar ID), chat_sessions (integer ID), chat_messages (integer ID), business_context
- **Challenge**: Migrating from integer IDs to UUID-based architecture for better scalability
- **Solution**: Hybrid approach maintaining compatibility while adding enhanced multi-agent features

## Enhanced Multi-Agent Architecture Tables

### 1. **business_plans** - BusinessPlanArchitect Documents
```sql
- Real-time business plan creation and versioning
- Multiple content formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF-ready JSON)
- Business metadata extraction (name, industry, funding goals)
- Export tracking and version control
- Parent-child plan relationships for iterations
```

### 2. **loan_applications** - LoanNavigator SBA Tracking  
```sql
- Complete SBA Express loan application lifecycle
- Eligibility scoring and lender matching algorithms
- Document requirements checklist with completion tracking
- AI-generated funding insights and risk assessments
- Multi-step application status progression
```

### 3. **operational_suggestions** - OpsSpecialist Recommendations
```sql
- Categorized business operation advice (hiring, tools, processes)
- Priority and difficulty scoring for implementation
- Cost estimation and timeframe planning
- Resource links and next-step action items
- Implementation tracking with user feedback
```

### 4. **ai_actions_log** - Comprehensive Agentic Intelligence Tracking
```sql
- Every AI action across all three copilots
- Performance metrics (processing time, token usage)
- Success/failure tracking with error logging
- Result data storage for audit trails
- Cost optimization and model performance analysis
```

### 5. Enhanced **business_context** - Cross-Copilot Intelligence
```sql
- Entity extraction with confidence scoring
- Cross-copilot data sharing capabilities
- Source tracking and verification workflow
- Intelligent categorization (company, product, market, competitor)
- Data quality management with verification states
```

## Key Architectural Improvements

### **Type Safety & Validation**
- PostgreSQL enums for consistent data types
- Proper decimal precision for financial calculations
- JSONB for flexible structured data storage
- Array fields for multi-value selections

### **Performance Optimization**
- Strategic indexing on user_id, copilot_type, status fields
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Foreign key constraints with proper cascade behavior
- Query optimization for cross-copilot data retrieval

### **SOC2 Compliance Features**
- UUID primary keys for security and scalability
- Audit trail with created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Data retention policies through status fields
- Privacy-compliant data deletion cascades
- Encryption-ready sensitive data identification

### **Business Intelligence Integration**
- AI action success rate tracking
- User engagement metrics across copilots
- Business plan completion analytics
- Loan application conversion tracking
- Operational implementation success rates

## Migration Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Add Enhanced Tables (Zero Downtime)
- Create new tables alongside existing ones
- Maintain backward compatibility with current integer IDs
- Implement dual-write pattern for gradual migration

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features Integration
- Update application logic to use new tables
- Cross-reference existing sessions with new copilot-specific data
- Implement business context extraction from historical chats

### Phase 3: Full UUID Migration (Future)
- Plan for eventual migration to full UUID architecture
- Maintain foreign key relationships during transition
- Archive legacy integer-based data appropriately

## Technology Stack Integration

### **Drizzle ORM Schema**
- Type-safe database operations
- Automatic TypeScript type generation
- Relation mapping for complex queries
- Migration-friendly schema evolution

### **Real-time Features**
- WebSocket integration for live business plan updates
- Cross-copilot context synchronization
- Agentic action status broadcasting
- User progress tracking across sessions

### **AI Integration Optimization**
- Token usage tracking for cost management
- Model performance analytics per copilot
- A/B testing framework for prompt optimization
- User satisfaction scoring per AI interaction

This architecture positions Fido as a truly agentic AI platform where each copilot maintains specialized expertise while sharing intelligent business context across the entire user journey.
